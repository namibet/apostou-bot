# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an automated testing bot for the Apostou betting platform that monitors performance metrics and reports issues via Slack. The bot tests login functionality, deposit processes (PIX), and game loading times across different casino providers.

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE**: This codebase is designed for legitimate performance monitoring and testing purposes. It should only be used for authorized testing of platforms you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular Python architecture:

- **`main.py`**: Orchestrates the entire testing flow - login, deposit testing, game testing, and Slack reporting
- **`utils/`**: Core utility modules for specific testing functions
- **`core/`**: Browser initialization and platform-specific test logic  
- **`alarm/`**: Notification system components
- **`log/`**: Runtime logs and execution history

### Key Data Flow

1. **Login Flow** (`utils/fazer_login.py`): Handles authentication, age confirmation, cookie acceptance
2. **Deposit Testing** (`utils/testar_deposito_pix.py`): Measures PIX deposit process timing
3. **Game Testing** (`utils/testar_jogos.py`): Tests loading times for casino games across providers (Pragmatic, PG, Evolution, Playtech, etc.)
4. **Metrics Collection** (`utils/registrar_tempo.py`): Records timing data to CSV with emoji-prefixed categories
5. **Slack Reporting** (`utils/reportar_slack.py`): Parses metrics and sends categorized alerts to different Slack channels

### Game Provider Architecture

The bot tests games from multiple providers with different loading indicators:
- **Pragmatic Play**: Waits for network requests containing "gameService"  
- **PG Games**: Waits for "Come√ßar" button visibility
- **Evolution Gaming**: Waits for specific JSON endpoints (e.g., "lightningdice.json")
- **Playtech**: Waits for "SALDO" text visibility
- **Aviator Studio**: Waits for "BRL" currency indicator

### Metrics System

Uses emoji prefixes for categorization:
- `üè†_` - Login/initialization steps
- `üíµ_` - Deposit-related processes  
- `üé∞_` - Game loading tests
- `‚ùå` suffix - Indicates failures/errors

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium
```

### Running the Bot
```bash
# Main execution (single run)
python main.py

# Continuous execution with scheduler 
python scheduler.py
```

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file with required credentials:
```bash
# Platform credentials
APOSTOU_USER=your_username
APOSTOU_PASS=your_password

# Slack integration
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token
BOT_SUCCESS=success_channel_id
BOT_ERROR_INIT=init_error_channel_id  
BOT_ERROR_DEPOSIT=deposit_error_channel_id
BOT_ERROR_GAMES=games_error_channel_id

# Google Sheets integration (optional)
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=path/to/service-account.json

# Scheduler configuration
INTERVALO_MINUTOS=2  # Interval between executions (default: 2 minutes)
```

### Virtual Environment
Always use the existing virtual environment:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Browser Configuration
- Uses Playwright with Chromium in non-headless mode
- Sets geolocation to Brazil (-25.4284, -49.2733) and pt-BR locale
- Enables geolocation permissions for location-based features

### Error Handling Strategy
- Each testing phase (init, deposit, games) has isolated error handling
- Failures in one phase don't prevent subsequent phases from running
- All errors are captured and reported via appropriate Slack channels
- Uses timeout-based failure detection (typically 5-15 seconds)

### Game Testing Logic
The bot switches between casino sections based on game type:
- Live games: Navigates to `/casino-live` 
- Regular casino games: Uses main casino section
- Implements provider-specific loading detection patterns
- Records timing from click-to-ready state for each game

### Slack Integration
- Categorizes reports by error type (init, deposit, games, success)
- Includes timing information and process duration
- Uses formatted messages with emojis for visual distinction
- Sends reports only when relevant events occur (non-empty categories)

### Automated Scheduling
The `scheduler.py` module provides continuous execution:
- Runs `main.py` as isolated subprocess to prevent memory leaks
- Configurable intervals via `INTERVALO_MINUTOS` environment variable
- Analyzes CSV results after each execution to track success/failure rates
- Provides real-time execution statistics and timing
- Handles process timeouts (30 minutes) and error recovery

### Google Sheets Integration
Optional integration for metrics persistence:
- Automatically creates worksheet columns based on executed tests
- Records execution start/end timestamps and total process time
- Stores timing data for all login, deposit, and game testing phases
- Requires service account JSON credentials and sheet sharing permissions
- See `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SETUP.md` for complete configuration instructions

## File Dependencies

Key import relationships:
- `main.py` ‚Üí imports all utility modules
- `utils/testar_jogos.py` ‚Üí depends on game-opening and loading-test utilities
- `utils/reportar_slack.py` ‚Üí requires `slack_notifier.py` for API communication
- All timing utilities ‚Üí depend on `registrar_tempo.py`

## Debugging and Monitoring

### Log Files
- **Runtime logs**: `/log/robo.log` - Contains execution logs and errors
- **Cron logs**: `cron.log` - Scheduler execution history
- **CSV metrics**: `/metricas/` - Timestamped execution results (e.g., `metricas_login_20250813_150529.csv`)

### Game Configuration
Games are defined in `main.py` with specific loading detection patterns:
- **provider**: Game provider identifier (pgmt, pg, evol, ptech, avst, pltp)
- **title**: Exact game name as it appears on the platform
- **tipo**: "cs" for casino games, "lv" for live games
- **wait_type**: "network" for network request detection, or omit for element visibility
- **wait_value**: String to detect (network endpoint, button text, or UI element)

## Testing Considerations

- The bot performs live testing on actual platform URLs
- Network timing dependencies make results variable based on connection quality  
- Browser automation may trigger platform anti-bot measures
- Ensure proper rate limiting between test runs to avoid IP restrictions
- No formal unit testing framework is configured - the system relies on integration testing against live services
